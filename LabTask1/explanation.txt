Putting '' can be used to run a command within a command, whereas piping with | is used to take the output on the left hand side and use it as an input for the right hand side. In this case, the first part wc `grep -l int *` iss running wc for the values returned by 'grep -l int *'. Since grep -l lists the file names withe matches, wc prints the number of new lines, words, and bytes for the files individually. In the case of the second part, grep -l int * | wc in order for the wc to return the number of new lines, words, and bytes, it needs to use the output from "grep -l int *". Here, the grep is searching for int in all the files of the current directory.
